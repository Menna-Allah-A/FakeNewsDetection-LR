# Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression | NLP & Machine Learning

🔍 Built a logistic regression model to classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake" using NLP techniques.
📊 **Key Steps**:

Text preprocessing (stemming, stopword removal).

Feature extraction with TF-IDF.

Achieved **97.9% accuracy** on test data.

🛠 **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas.

📌 **Insights**: Handled imbalanced data and optimized feature engineering.

🚀 **Next Steps**: Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit app or explore deep learning (BERT).
